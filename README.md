To apply a Z-probe array to a gcode file, drag the .CSV file with the array and the .Gcode file onto the gcodeAutoLevel.vbs script.

If the Z-probe array isn't in .CSV format, drag the text file with the Z-probe array data onto the convertTextToCSV.vbs script.  It will output a .CSV file, which can then be used with the gcodeAutoLevel.vbs script.
